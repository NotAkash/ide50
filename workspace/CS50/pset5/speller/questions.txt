Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

If we pass them by value,  two structures will be copied to calculate
  that's waste of time.


Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

1) Loads a textfile
2) Starts timing data
3) loads dictionary
4) Calculates time to load dictionary
5) Opens text
6) Checks for misspelling
7) Then waits till new word is found (non alpha character) 
8) Check for spelling errors in total
9) Checks for time taken
10) Checks for all otehr variables

Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

fscanf would have less customization, you can't make a program to skip non alphabetical characters.

Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

They're not meant to be changed in this func.
