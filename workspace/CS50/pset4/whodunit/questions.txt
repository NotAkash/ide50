--> What’s stdint.h?

stdint.h is a header file in the C  library to allow programmers to write 
more portable code by providing a set of typedefs 
that specify exact integer types, together with the defined
minimum and maximum allowable values for each type

--> What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

uint8, uint32, specify the space of bits for unsigned 8/32 bits int32 is used to use whatever
integer type your particular system has that is exactly 32 bits.

--> How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? 
BYTE:  1
DWORD: 4
LONG:  8
WORD:  2

--> What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading 
bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

ASCII: B and M
Decimal: 66 and 77
Hex: 42 and 4D

--> What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles, 
while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file. 
BiSize is constant and it equals 40 bytes

--> What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

--> What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount Specifies the number of bits per pixel (bpp). 

--> Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

If file is empty

--> Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

nmemb − This is the number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.

--> What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

3

--> What does fseek do?
Sets file indicator position

--> What is SEEK_CUR?

Takes you to the start of the file to read/write on.
